//*Question 46:* Enhanced Laptop Object: Construct an object for a laptop including properties make, model, year,

//*Question 50:* Multiline Template Literals: Use template literals to create a multiline string that describes your ideal day. Include at least three different activities.

// Starts with a list of numbers
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
// Doubles each number
let doubleNumbers = numbers.map(number => number * 2);
// Shows the new list of doubled numbers

// This line takes each number, doubles it, and puts it in a new list.
//*Question 56:* Keep Only Strings: Given a mix of different types of items, make a new list that has only the words.
//*Explain & TIP:* We can pick out just the words from a mixed bag of items, creating a list that includes only those words.
// A mixed bag of items
let mixedArray = [1, "Apple", 2, "Banana", true, "carrot"];
// Picks out only the words
let stringsArray = mixedArray.filter(items => typeof items === "string");
// Shows the list of just words
console.log(stringsArray); // Output: ["apple", "banana", "carrot"]
// This line checks each item: if it's a word, it goes into the new list.
//*Question 57:* Find the Average Grade: Given a list of grades, calculate the average grade.
//*Explain & TIP:* We can sum up all the grades and divide by the number of grades to find the average, giving us an idea of how well someone did overall.
// A list of grades
let grades = [82, 95, 76, 89, 44, 71];
// Calculates the average grade
let averageGrade = grades.reduce((total, grade) => total + grade, 0) / grades.length;

//<====================ðŸš€ *Day 20 Challenge: Start Coding!* ðŸš€====================>
//*Question 58:* Average Score Calculator: Write a simple program that can take lots of scores and find their average.

// This program calculates the average of all scores given
function averageScore(...scores) {
    // Adds all scores together and divides by the number of scores
    let total = scores.reduce((sum, score) => sum + score, 0);
    return total / scores.length;
}
// Example: finding the average of four scores
console.log(averageScore(80, 90, 100, 70)); // Shows the average score
// We add up all the scores, then divide by how many there are.
//*Question 59:* Add a Special Number: Make a program that creates custom adders. These adders can add a specific number to any other number you give them later.
//*Explain & TIP:* Imagine you have a magic box that can add a specific number to any number you put in it. This program makes that magic box for you!
// This program makes a function that adds a specific number
function makeAdder(valueToAdd) {
    // This is the magic box. It takes a number and adds your special number to it
    return function (number) {
        return number + valueToAdd;

// Making a magic box that adds 5
let addFive = makeAdder(5);

// We made a function (magic box) that adds 5 to any number.
//*Question 60:* Self-Running User Profile: Create a quick, self-setup profile for a user that can tell you the user's name and age.
//*Explain & TIP:* This is like a self-building lego set. Once you start it, it builds a user profile by itself and can tell you about the user.
// This profile sets itself up and can share info about the user
let userProfile = (function () {
    // The user's details are kept inside
